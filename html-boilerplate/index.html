        <h1>Very descriptive title</h1>
        <h2>Title in h2</h2>

        <p>
            Example of paragraph number one. Just a paragraph, not really impressive. The idea is that 
            this display some content that tries to fill the webpage because is too empty. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Example of paragraph number two. Another paragraph less important than the previous one. 
            <strong>We can turn text into bold text</strong> with the strong tag. We can turn the text
            <em>into italic with em tag.</em>
